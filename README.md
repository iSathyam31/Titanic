# Titanic
I recently completed a data analysis project on the Titanic Survivors dataset, which I obtained from Kaggle. For this analysis, I utilized the R programming language, a powerful tool for data manipulation and visualization. The dataset provided a wealth of information about the passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic, including details such as age, gender, class, and survival status


**Attributes	in the dataset**
sex	--> Male/Female
age	--> Age of the passesnger
sibsp -->	siblings of the passenger	
parch	--> parents / children aboard the Titanic	0/1/2 â€¦
fare -->	Passenger fare	
embarked -->	Port of Embarkation	C : Cherbourg, Q : Queenstown, S : Southampton
class -->	Ticket class	First / Second / Third
who -->	categories to passengers	male, female, child
alone -->	Alone status of the passesnger , YES-1 , NO-0
survived	--> Did the passenger survive or not	, YES-1 , NO-0
